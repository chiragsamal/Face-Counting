# Face-Counting-in-5-lines

A hot research area in computer vision is to build software that understands the human face. The most obvious application is Face Recognition, but we can also do lots of other cool stuff like Head Pose Estimation, Emotion Detection, Eye Gaze Estimation, and Face Recognition, Face counting and many more.

In this project I tried to build a Face Counting with just 5 lines of code. The model scans an image and find all rectangular areas that contains faces and calculates the number of faces in a given frame.
